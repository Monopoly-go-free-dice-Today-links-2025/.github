## What Are Dice in Monopoly GO?

Dice are the main resource in Monopoly GO. Every roll of the dice allows you to move around the game board. Each roll can lead to various outcomes, like earning coins, unlocking special cards, or activating events.

Without dice, you cannot play the game. Thatâ€™s why having enough dice is crucial. While the game gives you a limited number of dice every few hours, this may not be enough if you play often. To keep playing, many players look for ways to get free dice.
